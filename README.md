I would like to note that my codes are originial as they can be, but I was motivated to work on this problem by following the book "Python for Finance'. Example 1.2 Monte Carlo	estimator	for	European	option was the original problem which is associated with this program and where the values for the parameters were taken. The calculation for MC estimator is shown below.
